# PARAPHRASING-TOOL-USING-GAP-SENTENCES-OF-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS

Paraphrasing using machine learning is implemented which is the process of creating  multiple sentences with more accurate and grammar rich using PyTorch and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The paraphrases are most commonly used in many places to make the content non plagiarized. Te issue of plagiarism is considered to be a very serious offense in the field of academics. Drafting the assignments by lending out someone else ideology with no proper acknowledgement is purely unethical as per the academics. However, pre-training objectives tailored for abstractive text summarization have not been explored. In this work, we propose pre-training large Transformer-based encoder-decoder models on  massive text corpora with a new self-supervised objective. We review the different processes for paraphrasing and describe the effectiveness and shortcomings of the different methods. This Project concentrates on creating a model to paraphrase the work and to reduce the manual work and speed up the process required to it.
