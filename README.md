# PARAPHRASING-TOOL-USING-GAP-SENTENCES-OF-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS

The process of generating new and grammatically correct sentences that convey the same meaning as the original content is known as paraphrasing. This is accomplished through the use of machine learning techniques such as PyTorch and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Paraphrasing is commonly used to avoid plagiarism, which is considered a major violation in the academic field. Presenting someone else's ideas as your own without proper credit is considered unethical in academics.

In this project, we aim to advance the field of abstractive text summarization by proposing the use of pre-training large Transformer-based encoder-decoder models on vast text corpora with a new self-supervised objective. We will examine various methods of paraphrasing and their effectiveness and limitations. The goal of this project is to create a model that can automate the process of paraphrasing and speed up the time required to complete this task, reducing the need for manual effort.
